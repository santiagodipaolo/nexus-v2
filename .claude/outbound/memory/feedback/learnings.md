## Pre-Launch Learnings (From Research)

### 2026-02-05 — LoopGTM Proposal Analysis
**Context**: Analyzed LoopGTM's $5K/mo proposal for programmatic GTM
**What We Learned**: Their system uses Clay + Instantly + Prospeo + Bounceban + OpenAI. The strategy is solid but the tooling cost is only ~$650/mo — the $5K is for labor and expertise.
**Why It Matters**: We can replicate the tooling for ~$517/mo and use Claude as the "expertise layer"
**Applied**: Built the entire outbound system in-house with 6 AI agents

### 2026-02-05 — Nearshoring Cold Email is Hard
**Context**: LoopGTM explicitly states "nearshoring is one of the hardest industries to run outbound for"
**What We Learned**: Everyone says the same thing. Prospects lump you with hundreds of vendors. Differentiation is critical.
**Why It Matters**: Generic messaging will fail. We MUST lead with: (1) specific intent signal, (2) risk-free offer, (3) transparent pricing
**Applied**: Every workflow has waterfall copy logic based on enrichment data, not generic templates

### 2026-02-05 — No Social Proof Strategy
**Context**: We have zero clients and zero case studies
**What We Learned**: Risk reversal ("no match = no fee") + industry salary data + operational credibility can substitute for social proof in early stage
**Why It Matters**: Copy must evolve as we gain clients. Document the evolution path.
**Applied**: Created social-proof.md with 5-stage evolution plan
