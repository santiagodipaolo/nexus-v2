## Social Proof Evolution Plan

### Stage 0: Now (0 clients)
**Strategy**: Lead with risk-free offer + hard data
```
Copy examples:
- "Zero risk: if we don't find someone you love, you pay nothing."
- "A [role] in the US costs ~$[X]/mo. Same role from LATAM: ~$[Y]/mo."
- "We pre-vet candidates (only top 3% pass) and present matches in under 14 days."
```

### Stage 1: First Wins (1-3 clients)
**Strategy**: Add anonymous social proof
```
Copy examples:
- "We recently placed a Senior React Developer for a Series A fintech in Austin — they started in 18 days."
- "One of our clients cut their engineering costs by 55% while scaling from 5 to 12 developers."
```

### Stage 2: Named Testimonials (3-5 clients)
**Strategy**: Ask for testimonials, use with permission
```
Action items:
- After first successful placement, ask for a 2-sentence testimonial
- After 3 months, ask for a case study interview
- Offer discount in exchange for testimonial/case study
```

### Stage 3: Dynamic Social Proof (5-10 clients)
**Strategy**: Match social proof to prospect's industry/role
```
Copy examples:
- To a SaaS company: "[SaaS Client Name] hired 4 engineers through us and saved $X/year"
- To a fintech: "[Fintech Client] scaled their compliance team from 2 to 8 in 45 days"
```

### Stage 4: Full Library (10+ clients)
**Strategy**: Build social proof database by vertical, role, and company size
```
Structure:
| Client | Industry | Role Placed | Outcome | Timeline | Quote |
|--------|----------|-------------|---------|----------|-------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
```

## Case Studies (To Be Added)

### Template for Future Case Studies
```
## [Client Name] — [Industry]

**Challenge**: [What problem they had]
**Solution**: [What Nexus did]
**Results**:
- [Metric 1]: [Before] → [After]
- [Metric 2]: [Before] → [After]
- [Timeline]: [How fast]

**Quote**: "[Testimonial from client]" — [Name], [Title] at [Company]
```

## Social Proof Collection Process
1. After successful placement → ask for LinkedIn recommendation
2. After 30 days → ask for 2-sentence email testimonial
3. After 90 days → ask for case study interview (15 min call)
4. After 6 months → ask for G2/Clutch review
5. Always → track metrics (time to hire, savings %, roles placed)

**Note**: Update this file EVERY TIME we get a new client, testimonial, or metric. Social proof is the #1 lever for improving reply rates.
