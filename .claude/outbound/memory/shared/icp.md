### Target Buyer Personas

#### Persona 1: VP Engineering / CTO (Primary — Tech Hiring)
- **Pain**: Can't hire fast enough, budget constraints, US talent too expensive
- **Trigger**: Open engineering roles, team growth mandated, runway pressure
- **Message angle**: "Same quality engineers, 40-70% less, same timezone"
- **Decision power**: Direct hiring budget authority

#### Persona 2: VP Operations / COO (Primary — Operations Hiring)
- **Pain**: Scaling ops without proportional cost increase
- **Trigger**: Customer support growth, admin bottleneck, new market expansion
- **Message angle**: "Scale your ops team without scaling your costs"
- **Decision power**: Operations budget authority

#### Persona 3: CEO / Founder (Primary — Small Companies <50 employees)
- **Pain**: Wearing too many hats, need to hire but budget is tight
- **Trigger**: Post-fundraise, product-market fit achieved, growth pressure
- **Message angle**: "Stretch your runway 2-3x with LATAM talent"
- **Decision power**: All budget authority

#### Persona 4: VP HR / Head of People (Secondary)
- **Pain**: Expanding talent pool, diversity goals, hard-to-fill roles
- **Trigger**: Multiple open roles unfilled for 30+ days
- **Message angle**: "Expand your talent pool to 600M+ professionals in LATAM"
- **Decision power**: Influences, but may need exec approval
