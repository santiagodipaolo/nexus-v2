## Primary KPIs (Northstar Metrics)

### 1. Meetings Booked per Month
**Current**: 0/month

| Phase | Base (minimum) | Target (realistic) | Stretch (optimistic) |
|-------|---------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Phase 1-2 (Wk 1-5) | 5 | 10 | 20 |
| Phase 3 (Wk 6-10) | 15 | 25-30 | 40 |
| Phase 4 (Wk 11+) | 30 | 50 | 80+ |

**Why This Matters**: Meetings = pipeline. Pipeline = revenue. Everything else supports this.

### 2. Positive Reply Rate
**Current**: N/A

| Phase | Base | Target | Stretch |
|-------|------|--------|---------|
| Phase 2 | 1% | 2% | 3.5% |
| Phase 3 | 1.5% | 2.5% | 4% |
| Phase 4 | 2% | 3% | 5% |

**Industry benchmark**: Cold email positive reply rates in B2B services: 1-3% is good, 3-5% is excellent.

### 3. Revenue from Outbound (Monthly)

| Phase 4 (Wk 11+) | $15K | $25-40K | $60K+ |

**Note**: Revenue depends on close rate and deal size. Assume avg deal = $3-5K/month recurring.

## Budget Tracking

### Monthly Budget: $500-800/month

| Item | Planned | Actual |
|------|---------|--------|
| Clay (Pro) | $149 | — |

| OpenAI API | $30 | — |
| Domains (amortized) | $4 | — |
| **TOTAL** | **$517** | **—** |

### ROI Calculation
```
Monthly tool cost: ~$517
If 1 client closed from outbound: $3-5K MRR
Break-even: 1 client every 6-10 months (extremely conservative)
Target: 2-5 clients/month from outbound by Phase 4
Expected ROI: 10-50x tool investment
```

## Tracking Cadence

### Weekly (every Monday)
- Emails sent (total + per workflow)
- Open rate, reply rate, positive reply rate
- Meetings booked
- Deliverability health (inbox placement, bounces, complaints)
- A/B test updates

### Monthly (first Monday)
- Full KPI review vs base/target/stretch
- Workflow comparison (which to scale/kill)
- Budget vs actual
- Pipeline review and forecast
- Learning documentation
- Next month priorities

---

## Alert Thresholds
- Reply rate drops >50% week-over-week → investigate copy
- Inbox placement <85% on any domain → pause that domain
- 0 meetings in any 2-week period → strategic review
- Bounce rate >4% on any campaign → pause and revalidate list
- Budget exceeds $800/month → escalate to Santiago

---

**Remember**: These are 3-tier targets. Hitting "Base" consistently is success. Don't optimize for Stretch at the expense of system health.
