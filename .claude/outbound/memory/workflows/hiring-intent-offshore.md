# Workflow 3: Hiring Intent — Offshore Non-LATAM

**Priority**: MEDIUM (good angle, moderate volume)
**Status**: Not started
**Phase**: Launch in Phase 3

---

## Intent Signal
US companies with teams in Asia (India, Philippines, Vietnam) or Eastern Europe (Ukraine, Poland, Romania) experiencing timezone or communication friction.

## Why This Works
Companies with offshore teams in Asia/EE already buy into remote/offshore. Their #1 pain is timezone gaps (8-12h difference). LATAM offers comparable quality with 0-3h timezone overlap.

## Data Sources
| Source | How to Use | Refresh |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| LinkedIn | Employees by location (India, Philippines, Ukraine, Poland) | Weekly |
| Clay | Employee location enrichment | Per batch |
| BuiltWith/Wappalyzer | Tech companies with India/EE dev teams | Monthly |

## Search Criteria

**Include**:
- US/Canada HQ, 20-500 employees
- Has 3+ employees in Asia or Eastern Europe
- Hiring for roles we can fill

**Exclude**:
- Companies FROM those regions (Indian IT firms, etc.)
- Already has significant LATAM presence (→ Workflow 2)
- Outsourcing/offshoring agencies
- Blocklist, current clients

## Copy Angle
Primary: "Timezone gaps slowing you down? LATAM = same quality, same timezone."

### Waterfall Logic
```
IF offshore_india → "With your team in India, 10+ hour gap creates async delays. LATAM overlaps with US hours."
IF offshore_philippines → "Philippines is solid, but overnight waits for responses. LATAM works in your timezone."
IF offshore_eastern_europe → "Eastern Europe has great talent, but 6-8h gap limits real-time collab. LATAM gives 0-3h overlap."
IF also_hiring_us → "Hiring US-based alongside your [region] team. LATAM = timezone aligned + 40-70% less."
```

## Volume & Expectations
| Metric | Base | Target | Stretch |
|--------|------|--------|---------|
| Leads/month | 100 | 150 | 200 |
| Positive reply rate | 1.5% | 2.5% | 3.5% |
| Meetings/month | 3 | 6 | 10 |

## Notes
- Never badmouth their current offshore partner — focus on timezone benefits
- "Complement, don't replace" is a good angle for large companies
- Some will be locked into contracts — plant seeds for renewal time
