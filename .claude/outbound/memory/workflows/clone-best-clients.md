# Workflow 8: Clone Best Clients (Lookalike)

**Priority**: LOW-MEDIUM (depends on having clients)
**Status**: Not started — requires client data
**Phase**: Launch in Phase 3-4

---

## Intent Signal
Companies similar to Nexus's best clients in industry, size, tech stack, growth stage, and hiring patterns.

## Why This Works
Lookalike targeting is highly effective because the ICP is proven, not theoretical. If a SaaS company with 80 employees and Series B became a great client, hundreds of similar companies would too.

## Prerequisites
- Need 3-5 active Nexus clients minimum
- Client data needed: industry, size, funding stage, roles placed, tech stack

## Data Sources
| Source | How to Use | Refresh |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Clay | Lookalike company search | Per batch |
| LinkedIn Sales Navigator | Similar companies feature | Monthly |
| Apollo | Company search matching client profile | Monthly |
| Crunchbase | Similar companies by industry/stage | Monthly |

## Search Criteria (Template — Customize Per Client)

**Include**:
- Same industry as best client
- Similar size (±50% employees)
- Similar funding stage (±1 stage)
- US-based, hiring for similar roles

**Exclude**:
- The client themselves
- Already contacted in other workflows
- Direct competitors of the client (may cause conflict)
- Blocklist, current clients

## Copy Angle
Primary: Lead magnet approach — reference success without naming client (until permission).

### Copy Evolution
```
Stage 0 (anonymous): "A [industry] company your size reduced hiring costs by 55% with LATAM talent."
Stage 1 (permission): "{{client}} hired 4 LATAM engineers through us, saved $X/year. Your team looks similar."
Stage 2 (case study): "Here's how {{client}} built a 10-person LATAM team in 60 days. [case study link]"
```

## Volume & Expectations
| Metric | Base | Target | Stretch |
|--------|------|--------|---------|
| Leads/month | 50 | 75 | 100 |
| Positive reply rate | 1.5% | 2.5% | 3.5% |
| Meetings/month | 2 | 4 | 6 |

## Notes
- Gets better over time as we get more clients
- More diverse client base = more lookalikes to target
- Always ask clients for permission before naming them
- Combine with lead magnet content (case studies, reports)
- Eventually becomes highest-converting workflow once social proof is strong
