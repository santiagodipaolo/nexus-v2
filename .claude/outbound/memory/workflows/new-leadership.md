# Workflow 6: New Leadership Intent

**Priority**: HIGH (great timing signal, strong conversion)
**Status**: Not started
**Phase**: Launch in Phase 2

---

## Intent Signal
US tech companies where a new CTO, VP Engineering, VP Operations, Head of People, or COO started in the last 90 days.

## Why This Works
New leaders have: fresh mandate, new budget cycle, desire to make their mark. They're actively looking for ways to build/restructure teams. Haven't yet formed vendor relationships — highly receptive.

## Data Sources
| Source | How to Use | Refresh |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| LinkedIn Sales Navigator | Job change alerts for target titles | Daily/Weekly |
| LinkedIn | "Started new position" filter | Weekly |
| Clay | Leadership change detection | Per batch |
| Google Alerts | "[company] hires new CTO/VP" | Daily |

## Search Criteria

**Include**:
- US/Canada companies, 20-500 employees
- New leader started in last 90 days
- Titles: CTO, VP Engineering, VP Operations, COO, Head of Engineering, Head of People, VP HR, Head of Talent
- Tech/SaaS/Fintech companies

**Exclude**:
- Lateral moves within same company
- C-suite at enterprise >500 (too complex)
- Non-tech industries
- Blocklist, current clients

## Enrichment Layers
1. Leader's name, title, start date
2. Previous company and role (personalization gold)
3. Company's current hiring activity
4. Existing offshore presence
5. Leader's LinkedIn profile (for LinkedIn outreach)

## Copy Angle
Primary: "New role, new opportunity. Build your team smarter with LATAM talent."

### Waterfall Logic
```
IF new_cto_vp_eng → "Congrats on the new role at {{company}}. Building engineering? LATAM = same timezone, 50-60% less."
IF new_vp_ops_coo → "Congrats on joining {{company}}. Scaling ops efficiently? LATAM professionals = bilingual, timezone-aligned, 40-70% less."
IF new_head_people → "Congrats. Expanding the talent pool? LATAM = 600M+ professionals, pre-vetted, timezone-aligned."
IF company_is_hiring → "{{company}} has {{X}} open roles. New leadership + hiring pressure — we help hire LATAM talent in under 21 days."
IF previous_company_used_latam → "At {{prev_company}}, you worked with LATAM talent. Planning something similar at {{company}}?"
```

## Volume & Expectations
| Metric | Base | Target | Stretch |
|--------|------|--------|---------|
| Leads/month | 100 | 150 | 200 |
| Positive reply rate | 2% | 3% | 4% |
| Meetings/month | 4 | 7 | 12 |

## Timing
- Sweet spot: 30-60 days after start date
- Too early (<14 days): Still onboarding, too busy
- Too late (>90 days): Already formed vendor relationships

## Notes
- One of highest-converting workflows due to perfect timing
- Personalization is key — mention specific title and company
- LinkedIn connection request works especially well here (congratulatory angle)
- If they came from a company that used LATAM talent → mention it
