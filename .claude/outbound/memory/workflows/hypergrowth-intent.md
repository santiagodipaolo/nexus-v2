# Workflow 5: Hypergrowth Intent

**Priority**: MEDIUM (clear signal, moderate volume)
**Status**: Not started
**Phase**: Launch in Phase 3

---

## Intent Signal
US companies with 25%+ headcount growth in 6 months OR 20+ open roles simultaneously.

## Why This Works
Rapid growth = hiring bottleneck. These companies can't fill roles fast enough through traditional channels. LATAM = faster and cheaper scaling.

## Data Sources
| Source | How to Use | Refresh |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| LinkedIn | Headcount growth data (company insights) | Monthly |
| LinkedIn Sales Navigator | Filter by growth rate | Monthly |
| Job boards (aggregated) | Count open roles per company | Weekly |
| Clay | Growth signals + enrichment | Per batch |

## Search Criteria

**Include**:
- US/Canada HQ, 30-500 employees
- Headcount growth >25% in 6 months OR 20+ open roles
- Tech/SaaS/Fintech/E-commerce

**Exclude**:
- Growth through acquisition (not organic)
- Seasonal growth (retail Q4)
- Staffing/outsourcing firms
- Blocklist, current clients

## Copy Angle
Primary: "Growing fast? LATAM talent helps you scale without US price tag."

### Waterfall Logic
```
IF many_open_roles → "With {{open_roles}} open roles, recruiting must be a full-time challenge. We fill from LATAM in under 14 days."
IF headcount_growth → "Going from {{prev}} to {{current}} in 6 months — impressive. We keep that pace without tripling hiring costs."
IF hiring_engineering → "Scaling engineering fast? Pre-vetted LATAM engineers — same timezone, 50-60% less."
IF hiring_support_ops → "Growing support/ops? LATAM = bilingual, timezone-aligned, 40-70% less."
```

## Volume & Expectations
| Metric | Base | Target | Stretch |
|--------|------|--------|---------|
| Leads/month | 50 | 75 | 100 |
| Positive reply rate | 1.5% | 2.5% | 3.5% |
| Meetings/month | 2 | 4 | 6 |

## Notes
- Check for fundraising overlap — don't double-contact from Workflow 4
- Emphasize SPEED — "candidates in 14 days", "hire in 21 days"
- Potential for larger deals (multiple hires)
