# Cold Email Best Practices — Nexus Outbound

## The Golden Rules

### 1. Relevance > Everything
The #1 reason cold emails work is relevance. If you can prove you know WHY you're reaching out (intent signal), the prospect reads. If it's generic, it's deleted.

### 2. Short Wins
- Email 1: Under 100 words
- Email 2: Under 50 words
- Email 3: Under 60 words
- If you can say it in fewer words, do it

### 3. Write Like a Human
- No corporate speak. No "I hope this email finds you well"
- Lowercase is fine. Casual is good
- Write like you'd text a colleague, not a press release

### 4. One CTA Per Email
- Never ask for two things. One question. One action.
- Soft CTA first (Email 1), direct CTA later (Email 3)

### 5. Always End With a Question
- Questions get replies. Statements don't.
- "Worth a quick look?" > "Let me know if interested."

## Subject Line Rules
- Under 6 words (40 chars max)
- Include firstName or company name (personalization)
- Never use ALL CAPS or exclamation marks!!!
- No "RE:" or "FWD:" (spam filters catch this)
- No emojis (test first — can hurt deliverability)
- Best formula: `{{firstName}}, [short hook]`

## Email Structure
```
Line 1: WHY you're reaching out (intent signal — the hook)
Line 2: CONTEXT (secondary signal, waterfall logic)
Line 3-4: VALUE PROP (what you offer, credibility)
Line 5: CTA (question)
Signature (minimal)
```

## What NOT to Include
- ❌ Images or logos (hurt deliverability)
- ❌ HTML formatting or colored text
- ❌ More than 1 link (first email: zero links is best)
- ❌ Attachments
- ❌ Long signatures with social icons
- ❌ "Unsubscribe" link in first email (handled by sequencer)
- ❌ Spam words: free, guarantee, limited time, act now, exclusive offer

## Sending Best Practices
- **Days**: Tuesday-Thursday are best. Friday is acceptable. Monday and weekends are worst.
- **Time**: 8am-10am in prospect's timezone (opens first thing)
- **Spacing**: Email 2 at Day +3, Email 3 at Day +7. Don't pile up.
- **Volume**: Never more than 30 cold emails/day per mailbox
- **Reply**: If they reply (any reply), auto-stop the sequence

## Personalization Levels
| Level | Example | Impact |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 0 (None) | "Hi there" | Delete instantly |
| 1 (Name) | "Hi {{firstName}}" | Baseline |
| 2 (Company) | "Noticed {{company}} is hiring" | Good |
| 3 (Intent) | "Saw the {{role}} role at {{company}}" | Great |
| 4 (Deep) | "With your team in {{country}} + {{role}} in US..." | Best |

Always aim for Level 3-4.

## Follow-Up Strategy
- Don't apologize ("Sorry for following up")
- Don't reference previous email too heavily
- Add NEW value in each follow-up (data point, social proof, angle)
- After Email 3: wait 30 days, then re-engage with new signal if available

## Reply Handling
| Reply Type | Response Time | Action |
|------------|--------------|--------|
| Interested | Within 2 hours | Santiago/Shaan respond personally |
| Questions | Within 4 hours | Answer + offer call |
| "Not now" | Within 24 hours | Respect, ask if you can follow up in 3 months |
| "Not interested" | Within 24 hours | Thank them, remove from sequence |
| Referral | Within 24 hours | Thank them, add referral as new lead |
| Hostile/Negative | Do NOT reply | Add to blocklist, move on |
